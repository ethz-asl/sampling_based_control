 * Rate class for repeated processing at a certain rate.
 * The processing time is defined as the "awake" time, the time between the
 * "sleep" time. This class implements a sleep() method for sleeping for the
 * remaining time of the time step. Also statistics about the awake time are
 * taken.
 *
 * If the awake time is bigger than the time step (timing is violated),
 * there are two behaviors implemented:
 *
 * Enforce the rate: Try to keep the rate constant by compensating with shorter
 * time steps. |       |       |       |       |       |       |
 * |===--->|===--->|============|===|===-->|===--->|
 * |       |       |       |       |       |       |
 *
 * Do not enforce the rate: Try to keep the single time step constant.
 * |       |       |            |       |       |       |

 * Legend:
 *  |  Step time
 * === Awake time
 * --> Sleep time
 *
 * The time step, the time step thresholds for warnings and errors and the
 * setting to enforce the rate can be changed during run-time of this class.
