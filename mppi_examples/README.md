# mppi_examples

More information on each example reamde.

Examples list 
- [__mppi_first_order_mass__](mppi_first_order_mass/README.md): a 2D point mass, which is velocity controlled
- [__mppi_pole_cart__](mppi_pole_cart/README.md): a pole cart which is controlled applying a force to the cart. 
- [__mppi_panda__](mppi_panda/README.md): the Franka Emika 7dof arm for a target reaching task. The model is purely kinematic, meaning it perfectly tracks velocity inputs.
- [__mppi_panda_mobile__](mppi_panda_mobile/README.md): same as mppi_panda but with a mobile base.
- [__mppi_manipulation__](mppi_manipulation/README.md): stochastic control applied to a dynamic manipulator. The dynamic is modeled by the [raisim simulator](raisim.com). Objects like doors and drawers can be manipulated.
